This site connects people willing to freely advise others struggling with tech or product issues.

You can voluntarily donate money to an advisor, but it is not mandatory. The goal of this site is to help others.

### About volunteers

Volunteers are people willing to help by providing free advice. You can join as a volunteer if you would like to help others in your area of expertise. 

Users can freely choose an advisor according to their interests. To become an advisor, you need to provide a summary of your areas of expertise and your current professional references (LinkedIn, Blog, Twitter). 

Listening and understanding capabilities are highly valued and encouraged to achieve a successful advisement.

### About users

As a user, you can schedule a call with any advisor of your choice acording to your advisement needs. There's no sign-up process involved.

### Use cases

- Thinking about creating a new app but need some advice on software architecture, tech stack, deployments, etc.
- Have questions about product-market fit?
- Learning new technology and having problems understanding something.
- Don't know how to solve a problem with your current app.
- Need feedback about your UX/UI.
- Need feedback to validate an idea.
- Studying for certification and need some guidance/advice.
- Thinking about switching to the tech world and have some questions.

### How does it work?

Search through the list of people by looking at their skills and knowledge to find someone that matches your needs. You can look at their Blog, LinkedIn profiles, or Twitter to find out more about her/him.
It's important to pay attention to their location and languages to make sure your timezones or languages won't be a problem.
Once you find the right candidate, **schedule a call** with her/him. All candidates publish their calendars with possibles dates and times when they are available. After that, she/he will confirm the appointment and sent you a link to a videoconference platform to have the call.

### Do I have to pay for the advice?

Although it is not mandatory, a payment may be agreed between the parts independently.

All candidates can publish a **Donate to...** button so users can contribute with her/his donation to the advisor.
